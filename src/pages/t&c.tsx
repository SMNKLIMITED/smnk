            Terms and conditions for skilled workers and Employers:
          </Typography>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Only adults are expected to register on the SMNK platform. By
              adults, we mean those who are 17 years and above. Hence, all
              transactions must be between young adults (adults not less than 16
              and above). This is to achieve properly informed consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              A prospective client may choose not to provide all the necessary
              information needed to access the required service but some columns
              are considered basic and compulsory. This is to maintain privacy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Payments and monetary transactions shall be done through our
              approved platform hence, no direct deposits to the skilled
              personnel. SMNK is an intermediary between customers and service
              delivery experts and as such, all payments are to be made on the
              platform to enable us to protect the interest of both parties
              involved.
            </li>
            <li>
              SMNK shall not be held responsible for any private or direct
              business done on personal grounds with unapproved links
              unconnected with our website. This means services to be rendered
              must have been duly registered with us, to avoid impostors.
              Violators if caught would be penalized.
            </li>
            <li>
              The SMNK App would assure a seamless login and surfing experience
              hence report any difficulty that has lasted for more than 3 mins{" "}
              <li>
                {" "}

              SMNK is registered only in Nigeria for now and so operates within
